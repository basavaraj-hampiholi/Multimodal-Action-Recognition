Isolated gestures (IsoGD) [2]  is a large-scale multi-modal gesture recognition dataset derived from the Chalearn gesture dataset (CGD 2011). IsoGD contains gesture videos of two different modalities viz. RGB and depth with a resolution of 320Ã—240 pixels and a frame rate of 10 fps. The dataset is user independent, which means the participants in the training set are not repeated in the test set. In total, the dataset includes 47,933 RGB-D gesture videos with 249 gesture labels. The gestures were performed by 21 different individuals. The dataset is split into a training set with 35,878 samples from 17 participants, a validation set with 5,784 samples from 2 participants, and a test set with 6,271 samples from 2 participants.
